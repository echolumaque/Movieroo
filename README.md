## Overview
**Purpose**: This project is designed to showcase a wide variety of fundamental iOS development skills, including:
- Networking with `URLSession`
- Swift structured concurrency (`async`/`await`)
- Decoding JSON via `Codable`
- UIKit 
- `AutoLayout` for stunning user interface design
- Basic data persistence using `UserDefaults`
- Proper separation of responsibilities as per `VIPER`, and `MVVM-C` architecture design pattern
- Dependency Injection using `Swinject`
- `Cocoapods` for package management

## Features
- **Movie Catalog**  
  Fetched from [The Movie Database](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) using `URLSession`
- **Swift Concurrency**  
  Utilizes `async/await` to simplify network call syntax and handle concurrency safely.

## Architecture
This app is created with clear separation of responsibilities in mind. The movies tab is architected using the [VIPER pattern](https://medium.com/@pinarkocak/understanding-viper-pattern-619fa9a0b1f1), while the bookmarks tab is architected using [MVVM-C pattern](https://medium.com/sudo-by-icalia-labs/ios-architecture-mvvm-c-introduction-1-6-815204248518).

## Requirements
1. Xcode **16** or higher.
2. iOS **18** or higher.

## Room for Improvement
- Better Error Handling: Show a user-friendly message if the network fails.
- Caching: Implement image or fact caching to reduce repetitive network calls.
- Offline Mode: Persist previously loaded data so the user sees something if offline.
- Testing & Mocks: Expand unit test coverage, especially around network failures or decoding edge cases.
- UI Enhancements: Animate transitions between images and facts.
